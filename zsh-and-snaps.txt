As root, edit the /etc/zsh/zprofile file and add the following to the bottom of it:

  1)  emulate sh -c 'source /etc/profile'

This will likely fix a number of other PATHing issues that KDE may have been missing since it wasnâ€™t reading your shell profile.

If all you want to do is fix the SNAP integration with KDE, you can just add the following line to the bottom:

  1)  emulate sh -c 'source /etc/profile.d/apps-bin-path.sh'

Once that is done, restart your KDE instance (or reboot to be safe) and you should now see your SNAPS listed in the launcher.
